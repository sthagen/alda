= Releases and updates

== The v1 setup

I painted myself into a corner with the Alda v1 `alda update` mechanism. It uses
the GitHub API to inspect the latest release and downloads the first asset it
finds where the filename ends with `alda`.

If Alda v2 executables were to be uploaded to GitHub releases, then when Alda v1
users use `alda update`, they would end up with an `alda`(or `alda.exe`)
executable that won't work. At best, the downloaded executable wouldn't be able
to play anything because Alda v2 introduces a second executable that's also
required, `alda-player`, and at worst, the `alda` executable that `alda update`
finds might not run at all because it might not even be for the right OS/arch!

== The v2 setup

The suboptimal nature of the v1 setup made me realize that I'd really like for
something server-side (controlled by the maintainers of Alda) to decide which
release a user should download, based on context provided by the user, such as
what version of Alda (if any) the user currently has installed.

For example, if a user has Alda 1.4.0 installed, and there is a newer Alda 1.x
version available, as well as a 2.x version, then an API could tell the user
about these two recommended releases, and include an explanation about why the
user might choose one vs. the other.

If a user has Alda 2.0.1 installed and version 2.0.7 is available, then the API
could tell the user about version 2.0.7.

In addition to providing information about releases, the releases API would also
provide users with download URLs for specific releases. The typical workflow
(handled under the hood by the `alda` CLI) would be:

* User runs `alda update`.

* Alda CLI makes a request to the releases API for information about recommended
  versions, providing the currently installed Alda version for context.

* The releases API response includes:
** a list of releases, with release notes and download URLs for each release
** (optional) an explanation of why there are multiple version options

* If there is only one version option, the Alda CLI prompts the user to confirm
  whether they want to install that version.

* If there are multiple version options, the Alda CLI presents the above
  information to the user and asks the user to choose which release version
  they'd like to install.

* The Alda CLI downloads each of the executables for the user's OS/arch into the
  same directory as the currently running executable (`alda`), and (for
  non-Windows) marks them as executable.
** To replace `alda.exe` on Windows systems, we can use this trick:

=== Migration path for Alda v1 users

We will release one final 1.x version of Alda as a GitHub release, so that when
Alda v1 users run `alda update`, they will get that version.

This last version will still be functional (so as to avoid surprises or make
the user feel like they have no choice but to upgrade to Alda v2 in order to
continue using Alda), but any time it is run, the very first thing it will do is
print a message explaining that Alda 2.0 is now available, and to update to Alda
v2, the user can run `alda update`.

`alda update` will be reimplemented to follow the same process described above,
using the releases API to get information about the latest release and allowing
the user to install the latest Alda version (i.e. in the 2.x series).

== Release storage

Alda release assets are now stored in a DigitalOcean Space.

A CI/CD pipeline has been set up to automate the process of building the release
executables for Alda v2 and uploading them to the DigitalOcean Space.

The releases API is basically just a thin fa√ßade over the DigitalOcean Space,
which is a big ol' folder full of release assets.

== Releases API

This will be an everyday, boring, JSON over HTTP API. No need to get fancy.

=== Objects

==== Release

A release is represented as an object containing the following keys:

* `version` (string) - the version number
* `date` (string) - the release date, in `YYYY-MM-DD` format
* `changelog` (string) - a string of Markdown detailing changes in this release
* `assets` - an object mapping OS/arch strings to the list of Assets to be
downloaded for that OS/arch

==== Asset

* `type` (string) one of: `executable`, _(more in the future, if needed)_
* `name` (string) the name of the file, e.g. `alda`,  `alda.exe`, `alda-player`
* `url` (string) the public URL where the asset can be downloaded

=== Endpoints

==== `GET /releases/latest`

Success response::
An object with the following entries:
+
* `releases` - A list of Release objects, each describing a newer version of
Alda that the user can download.
+
If there are no releases available newer than the version provided in the
`from-version` query parameter, the list will be empty.
* `explanation` (optional) - A string describing why there are multiple version
choices and why the user might want to download one vs. another.

Error responses::
* If the version provided in the `from-version` query parameter cannot be parsed
as a (semantic) version string, this endpoint returns a 400 response.

Query parameters::
* `from-version=1.4.3` (optional) - the version of Alda that the user currently
has installed
+
When not provided, this endpoint will return _the_ latest version of Alda.

==== `GET /releases`

Success response::
An object with the following entries:
+
* `releases` - A list of Release objects representing all available Alda
releases.

==== `GET /release/1.2.3`

Success response::
A Release object.

Error responses::
* If no release is found with the provided version number, this endpoint returns
a 404 response.
