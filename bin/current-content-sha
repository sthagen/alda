# This script prints a git SHA that represents the current contents of this git
# repo, including any unstaged and untracked changes.
#
# To accomplish this, we run `git add --all` followed by `git write-tree`, and
# to ensure that this doesn't affect the current state of the git repo, we make
# a copy of the index first and use that instead of the actual index.
#
# Usage:
#
#   Print current content SHA of the repo as a whole:
#     current-content-sha
#
#   Print current content SHA of just the client directory:
#     current-content-sha client
#
#   Print current content SHA of just the player directory:
#     current-content-sha player

# Prepend the version number to force a rebuild when the top-level VERSION file
# changes. This way, we can make sure that the client and player pick up on the
# new version number and report the correct version.
