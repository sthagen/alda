# This script uses the current build of the client (i.e. the executable built
# from the current contents of the client/ directory) to run `alda ps`, or bails
# out if there is no current build.
#
# Generally, it's better to use client/bin/run to run the current build of the
# client, because it will do a build if there isn't one already. `alda ps` is
# different because it's useful to run it repeatedly with a command like:
#
#    watch -n 0.25 alda ps
#
# and a workflow like that doesn't play nice with client/bin/run.
